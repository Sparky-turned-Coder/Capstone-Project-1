<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<p>
    In my spare time I enjoy reading fantasy, science ficiton and horror novels. I dabble in writing stories of my own. I like playing video games, although that interest of mine is slowly fading away. I am also really enjoying learning to write code in my spare time. HTML has been a joy to create projects in and I'm excited to dive into CSS and Javascript.
